- Kubernetes is an application orchestrator

### Orchestrator
- Deploys your application
- Scales up and down dynamically
- Self heals when things break
- Zero downtime updates and rollbacks
### Containerized app
- App that runs on a container

- Kubernetes abstracts cloud resources into one massive pool
- The closest analogy to K8 is courier shipping
	- We will **package** our app in the standard box with a standard label and let someone else take care of the actual shipping
